  "notes": "New Star Stuff Function: GLIMR! Glimmer stand for GaLaxy Isophote Modeler & Residual Revealer. A very precise way to discover new structure in the cores of galaxies, especially elliptical galaxies.  Blink scroll fix: There was redundant stretching causing slow Blink scrolling. Blink is now very snappy when changing images like it used to be!"
